The 6502 resources we found compiled online did not reflect the hardware as much as expected
most likely due to the fact that the provided information was for developers using the 6502 and
not the actual design manual itself. 

We also found that the 6502 was made with some strange practices in mind - at the time, the design 
space was not as advanced and explored; for instance, modern CPUs do not use multi-phase clock signals.

Thus, we decided to make some educated guesses and edits to 'improve' the design for our use cases.
That said, we do intend for our 6502 to remain relatively authentic.

Notation:
-> is a 1 bit line,
=> is a 8 bit bus

Changes to Base Design Made:
    - INTERNAL DATA BUS=>DATA BUS BUFFER is now bidirectional
    - Created ADDR SELECT, a mux that selects between 16 bit input from Program counter and 16 bit input from
      Instruction Decode
        - Added a 2 8 bit busses INSTRUCTION DECODE=>ADDR SELECT
        - Set the 8 bit bus PCL=>ADL to PCL=>ADDR SELECT
