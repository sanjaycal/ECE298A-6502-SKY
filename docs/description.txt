The 6502 resources we found compiled online did not reflect the hardware as much as expected
most likely due to the fact that the provided information was for developers using the 6502 and
not the actual design manual itself. 

We also found that the 6502 was made with some strange practices in mind - at the time, microprocessor design 
space was not as advanced and explored; for instance, modern CPUs do not use multi-phase clock signals.

Thus, we decided to make some educated guesses and edits to 'improve' the design for our use cases, and make things easier.
Finally, our code freeze occured before we could add any ADDR X type instructions (incrementing for arrays), 
which were deemed non-essential as they could be implemented via software.

Overall though, we do intend for our 6502 to remain relatively authentic.
